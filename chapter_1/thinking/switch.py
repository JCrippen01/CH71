#The issue: I need my apples to output 11, and your apples to output 5.
myApples = 5
yourApples = 11

#to switch variables I am going to use pythons multiple variable solution in (x,y) format and set that equal to its opposit (y,x)
(myApples, yourApples) = (yourApples, myApples)
# I will then need to display the output.

print(myApples)
print(yourApples)
